; check to see if t is a balanced tree of cons cells,
; a value is a tree if it is a cons cell pairing a left sub-tree and right sub-tree, 
;                   or if it is any non-cons value (so all values are cons trees)
; we'll call such a a tree "balanced" if the minimal path to a non-cons leaf value is the
; same as the maximal path, or at most one less.

; append two lists, return a list containing each element of l0 followed by each element of l1

; takes a list of filters out any value other than a number?
(define (filter-numbers lst)

; returns true if a list contains one or more of the value '0, false ostherwise
; (added challenge: can you write this without using if/cond/match?)
(define (has-zeros? lst)

      #t
      #f))
; returns a list of the first n elements in lst (assume there are at least n elements)
(define (take-front lst n)
  'todo)

; returns lst without its first n elements (assume there are at least n elements)
(define (drop-front lst n)
  (list-tail '(lst) n))

; flattens a list so any/all nested lists are spliced in place
;   e.g., (flatten-list '(1 ((2 3)) 4 (5))) => '(1 2 3 4 5)
(define (flatten-list lst)
  (flatten lst))

; a list's depth is 0 if none of its elements are lists or one plus the depth of its deepest list-element
;   e.g., (list-depth '(1 2 ((()) 3 4) 5)) => 3
(define (list-depth lst)
